Spectral Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning
We employed operator learning and combined it with based approaches. 


what does that mean:
1) Instead of performing AD or trying to build equations by means of coordinates as input
   we use the Lippmann-Schwinger operator to build physical losses
2) Training time is in the same order as data-driven methodologies (even faster :)!)
